# üåä Ionio

Ionio is a higher-level language that allows you to write smart contracts for the Elements blockchain. It can compile instructions for Elements‚Äô execution environment, which targets Elements Tapscript and Simplicity.


## Credits 
The syntax is based on Bitcoin's smart contract language [Ivy](https://ivylang.org/bitcoin), but its functionality is enhanced since smart contracts for Elements differ greatly from smart contracts on Bitcoin.


## üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è JavaScript SDK

>‚ÑπÔ∏è Ionio only offers a JavaScript SDK, but Ionio contracts can be integrated into other languages as well. Because there are no ready-to-use SDKs available for them, this is considered advanced usage, and it is recommended to use the JavaScript SDK.


The JavaScript SDK can be installed into your project with NPM.

```bash
npm install @ionio-lang/ionio
```

Read more about the JavaScript SDK in the [SDK documentation](https://ionio-lang.org/docs/sdk/instantiation).


**Ionio is prototype software and is intended for educational purposes only**. Do not attempt to use Ionio to control real Bitcoins.
